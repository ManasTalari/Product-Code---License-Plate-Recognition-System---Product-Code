# License_Plate_Detect
This project aims to implement a license plate detection system leveraging OpenCV and Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition). The system is designed to identify license plates from images or video streams and extract the text from the detected plates. By combining computer vision techniques from OpenCV with the text recognition capabilities of Tesseract OCR, this system offers a robust solution for license plate detection tasks.  To get started, clone the repository to your local machine and install the necessary dependencies using pip. Once installed, you can use the provided Python script to run the license plate detection system. Simply specify the path to the image or video you want to analyze, and the system will output the detected license plates along with the extracted text.  The project includes examples of detected license plates to demonstrate the system's capabilities. These examples showcase the effectiveness of the license plate detection algorithm and its ability to accurately extract text from various types of license plates.
